Understand this argument about words not mattering.

The most important thing that we can do right now is to re-engage the American people in the process of governance.

To get them excited and interested again in what works and what can work in our government.

To make politics cool again. And important again. And relevant again.

Don't tell me words don't matter.

I have a dream - just words?

We owe these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal - just words?

We have nothing to fear but fear itself - just words, just speeches?

It's true that speeches don't solve all problems. But what is also true is if we cannot inspire the country to believe again, then it doesn't matter how many policies and plans we have.

And that why I'm running for President of the United States of America. And that's why we just won eight elections straight. Because the American people want to believe in change again.

Don't tell me words don't matter.

Don't tell me ideals and inspiration don't matter.

Don't tell me hope doesn't matter.
